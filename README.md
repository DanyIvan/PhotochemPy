# PhotochemPy
PhotochemPy is a atmospheric photochemical model of terrestrial atmospheres. It is an updated version of the `Atmos` photochemical model, originally developed by Jim Kasting and Kevin Zahnle and further developed by many of their students and colleges. 

## History
The code was originally written in Fortran 77. This version of the code is written in Fortran 90. It has been restructured so that it can be easily compliled as a Python package using `f2py`.
